# Reinforcement_learning_using_Thompson_sampling_in_Python
Our objective is to select best ad with a target of highest CTR(click Through Rate) in minimum number of trials. That is we want maximum exploitation with minimum exploration. We have 10 ads and we need to select the ad which would yield highest CTR(click through rate), in minimum number of trials. Thompson Sampling is a type of Reinforcement learning that works on the principle of rewards and punishment. Rather than performing exploration by simply selecting an arbitrary action, chosen with a probability that remains constant, the Thompson sampling works on expectation of outcome and with every trial, the expectation comes closer to true value, and based on this expectation, Thompson sampling selects the the next action. The exploration-exploitation balance changes as it gathers more knowledge of the environment. After certain trials, the ad with highest CTR is selected consecutively, improving the expectation and exploitation.
